# Landscape Photography in Maldives

This is another photography post showcasing landscape work from the Maldives. This demonstrates how you can have multiple photography posts in this separate section. (Will add jpgs in later.)

## Photography Techniques

When creating landscape photography, consider these principles:

1. **Composition**: Use the rule of thirds and leading lines
2. **Lighting**: Golden hour provides the most dramatic light
3. **Depth**: Include foreground elements to create depth
4. **Weather**: Embrace changing weather and light conditions

## Equipment Used

For this Maldives series, I used:
- **Camera**: Canon EOS R5
- **Lens**: 16-35mm f/2.8 L III
- **Filters**: ND filters for long exposures
- **Tripod**: Essential for landscape photography

- **Palm Trees**: Iconic silhouettes against vibrant sunsets
- **Coral Reefs**: Colorful underwater scenes and atolls
- **Islands**: Secluded islands and sandbanks perfect for wide shots
