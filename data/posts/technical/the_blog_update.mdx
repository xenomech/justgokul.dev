It's been a while since I wrote something technical. I've been planning an update for my blog for a long time. I wanted to try out the app router, server components, layouts and the other cool stuff in next 13 ðŸ™ˆ. So let's keep it short.

#### What are the updates?

1. **The app router:** The blog now uses the app router and RSC(react server components).
2. **New design:** I've wanted to update the design of the previous version for a long time. It was classic but had no artistic touch to it. So I went design hunting! Setting up a mood board and having a messy Figma file, yes! After spending some time, I came up with something I liked.
3. **Contentlayer:** I started using Contentlayer in my last blog, and since then, I have loved it. Sourcing the local markdown files has never been this easy.
4. **TypeScript:** Yes, the entire blog is built using typescript. Which helps write typesafe code and works well in conjunction with Contentlayer
5. **Switching to Vercel analytics:** Since Splitbee analytics is now Vercel analytics, it's easy to set up from Vercel's dashboard.
6. **Enhancements to the snippets page:** The snippet page now contains selected threads from Twitter. The tweets are just iframe embeds, with the Twitter v2 API being a paid service.

#### What is left to do?

1. **Codebase optimisation:** Obviously! the codebase requires optimisation, getting rid of codes that are repeating, stipping down unused classes and divs etc.
2. **Image delivery optimisation:** As you might have noticed, the blog is asset-heavy, and everything is served via Vercel's CDN, which is ok for the time being.
3. **Structured reusable components:** The components are folder organised; as the blog grows, the number of components will also increase. Introducing storybooks and writing tests for components will ensure better-quality failsafe components.

#### Improvements to sitemap!

```JS

const siteMap = {
  old: {
    blog: 'blog.justgokul.dev',
    shareSheet: 'justgokul.dev',
  },
  new: {
    blog: 'justgokul.dev',
    shareSheet: 'share.justgokul.dev',
  },
};

```
