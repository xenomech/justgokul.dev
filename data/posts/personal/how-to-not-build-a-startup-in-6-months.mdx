Well, that was click baity title, wasn't it? But, this is not a comprehensive guide on building startups or a blog post depicting how my startup failed. This blog is full of learnings and insights I gained from my experience building one up over six months. I'll be covering all the issues that I faced over the time.

## Context

I attempted to launch a consultancy startup, drawing from my experience as a software engineer with one and a half years of expertise in a product company, as well as a few months to a year of experience developing frontend and IoT applications in college as a freelancer. During my startup days, I generated around seven leads, of which I successfully converted four, ultimately closing one deal. That's the not-so-great statistical part right there. I'm sharing my insights and scope of improvements through this blog.

  This blog is just the insight of a 23-year-old “software engineer” who
  attempted to start a company from scratch. The decisions I made were based on
  my knowledge, experience, and the situations I faced at the time.

## Business Insights

### 1. The Presales conundrum

The main problem that I faced during my presales process was estimating timelines. I was not the sharpest tool in the shed regarding project estimate planning. A company is built by the collective effort of the staff, management, and clients at every level. When considering the clients, we must account for their to-and-fro emails and the dependencies with assets, accounts, and documentation. As a one-man army with multiple clients in the presales phase, I struggled to establish a clear timeline for each client. This was one of the things that acted as a foundational flaw for the initial client sprints that I had.

### 2. The expansion

The scope of expansion is kind of a well-calculated risk that a company should take. Be it expanding big or expanding small. As my timeline was messed up, I could have made it up by hiring interns or by hiring a freelancer. This expansion would have closed more deals. This was a tough decision to make as I was running off of my savings and my documentation process was not that solid. I had two options for handling clients in presales: complete the initial sprint and then search for clients for the next sprint or hire interns or freelancers, pay them, and finish the sprint while I focus on new clients.

### 3. Business documentation and capital

After understanding the nature of these documents, I have realised the mistakes I made in the past. Clients often demand numerous changes and improvements to their products, seeking to make it more attractive and modern. This results in a lot of extra work and time that was not initially accounted for, leading to a loss of effort and productivity. The maintenance of these documents is crucial in terms of the client and the company being on the same page. The business requirements I used to write were weak regarding how it was used afterwards. The scope (in-scope and out-scope: refer to BRD) was not clearly defined and change requests (CR) were not considered. If I had raised capital, I could have hired interns or freelancers. The best approach would have been to bill an advance after presales and then hire. However, my documentation strategy needed to be stronger to initiate a shorter working capital cycle. This flaw led me to do everything on my own and the capital cycle got bigger. It is possible to build without capital if there is a proper execution strategy generating a shorter capital cycle.

### 4. Marketing

The company's marketing efforts did not yield much success because most of the leads generated were offline, organic, and local. However, in today's digital age, online marketing is a crucial component of any marketing strategy, which includes social media marketing, email marketing, and more. Unfortunately, I could not execute this strategy because I was not using social media at the time. I realized the importance of social media as a source of marketing, hence breaking my two-year sobriety from it.

## Technical Insights

### 1. Don't reinvent the wheel.

Spending time building what is already being built is a waste of time. Others may have faced the same problem as you and have already shared a solution or idea for solving it. Experience helps you identify the problem and locate the solution. Most of the configs you use are going to be repeated all over again for another project, having a solid structure of prebuilds will help you save a lot of delivery time.

### 2. What you use is probably going to be fine.

The tech community is vast, however, not all of the latest and exciting technology is ready for production use. As a result, it may be better to stick with older, more established technology for the time being. Relying solely on Next.js for everything can be problematic - they release a new version every year, which may or may not require a migration for all the previous work. I used to discuss this with a friend of mine regularly, and it made me realize that it's essential to accept that what you use is probably going to be fine.

### 3. The tool is as good as the person using it.

Dude that's a sick app what's it built on? Was that pic edited in Lightroom? And it's fascinating to see that it is made with tools that are sub-optimal from a public standpoint. It doesn't matter if it is React, Vue or Angular. It doesn't matter if it's Rails, Nest or Django. At the end of the day, all that matters is whether it solves the problem optimally. In the past, I used to consider myself a jack of all trades, but now I'm starting to reconsider that decision. The vast array of technology stacks, innovative problem-solving techniques, and scalable architectures can lead to major analysis paralysis. If you are good at a certain stack you can convert your idea to reality with it easily, optimally and effectively.

## Personal Insights

### 1. What you water is what grows.

As in business, in life too what you focus on is what grows. If it's the failure and disappointment you focus more on it is what grows inside you. If it's a craft that you are more focused on it is gonna take you places. It is important to identify the flaws and have a rectification strategy in place as soon as possible.

### 2. If you are good at something don't do it for free

Well, people who know me know that this was a tough nut to crack. Subconsciously underestimating work, presentation and ability devalues its worth.

### 3. Sometimes the wrong turn is a right turn.

Sometimes things won't work out the way you want them to work out. That doesn't mean that you took a wrong turn somewhere and even if you did you can always change course if you want to.

“You can have it all, But not all at once"
“If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.”

### 4. Zones, areas and the whole map of restriction.

As a human being, it is common to have imposter syndrome, anxiety, inferiority-superiority complex, ego and all the other interpersonal issues. Having to deal with people is a skill that requires patience, which I wasn't capable of. I won't say that I joined the Peacekeeping Corps in just a few months, but there have been significant improvements in the way I deal with people now.

The marketing game that a product or company should play is something I chose to opt out of during college, but now we are revisiting marketing strategies. As the saying goes, "You gotta do what you gotta do". However, constantly creating and posting content, as well as promoting products in every possible platform to grab the user's attention, seems quite desperate to me. I think this is an area where a perspective change and some solid experience will help me out.
