Time — the uncontrolled flow of life. The past, the present, and the future are all intertwined within us. We often look back on our memories, feeling nostalgic about how our lives have unfolded. We look ahead and feel the spark of possibility the drive to become what we imagine. And in rare, precious moments, we are fully present: in flow, building, creating, shaping something that inspires us.

I used to treasure those memories, trying to keep them safe, as if they were a box full of polaroids freezing time to the tiniest fraction of a second. The camera, once forgotten, became my anchor to those fleeting moments. What began as a fun excuse to bunk classes, to try to be creative outside the four walls, has now grown into something that I cannot let go of. From a borrowed Canon 1300D to a Canon IXUS 190, through mobile devices, and finally to the Sony a6400.  I kept collecting memories like seashells washed ashore by the ocean; the ocean that is always in motion. The sea teaches us the language of movement, the rhythm, the steady cycle of coming and going, the endless push and pull. Always a step ahead of the click. That’s the paradox of both time and photos no matter how fast we press the shutter, life has already moved on. The photo is never the present; it’s already the past. And yet, in capturing it, we make the fleeting permanent, giving ourselves a way back into moments we might otherwise lose. 

“Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.”
― Ferris Bueller

In the bustle of the city, in the hum of keystrokes, we usually forget to pause. To hold a moment still. To let it breathe so that we can keep it forever. The clink of glasses over a bar counter with friends. Laughter spilling through a car with family. The smell of soil after a fresh rain. A foggy road. The mountain top after a long trek. The ocean breeze on your face. The fragments of life worth keeping. A photograph, a memory, a fleeting image proving that beauty hides in the ordinary. Not every frame is grand, not every scene dramatic. Sometimes it is the stillness between conversations, the quiet after laughter, the hush before dawn. To pause, to notice, to preserve. Moments slip past quickly, unnoticed in their simplicity.

Over the years, I’ve realized photography is often not about freezing time. It's often about learning to live with it. Each image reminds us that change is constant, that nothing stays except what we choose to hold on to. The camera doesn’t stop time. It teaches us to notice it, to respect it, to carry it forward.
